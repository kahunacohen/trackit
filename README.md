# trackit
`trackit` is a cross-platform, light-weight CLI (command-line-interface) personal finance tracking tool. It's
meant for power-users (programmer types) who prefer working on the command-line over GUIs.

## Features
- [x] Cost: free.
- [x] Cross-platform: MacOS, Windows, Ubantu.
- [x] Entirely offline: no internet connection needed, and thus, no inherent privacy concerns.
- [x] Sycning: leverages file-based [sqlite](https://sqlite.org/) database, so you are in charge of how
   (or if you even want to) sync the `*.db` file across multiple devices.
- [x] Performance: fast (see above).
- [x] Multi currencies: yes!
- [x] Categorize transactions: tag with built-in categories, or manage your own custom categories.
- [x] Ignore selected transactions: Mark certain transactions (such as transfers), so they don't get included in
      sums/aggregation.
